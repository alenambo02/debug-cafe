The Debug Café “POS” (point-of-sale) is a web application designed to help facilitate online coffee shop orders and transactions. While its name implies its intended function for coffee shop orders, it can be used for a variety of other forms of retailing.

This project utilizes the MVC pattern that helps divide application logic into three main components: 
- The model,
- the view,
- and the controller.


Below is an image that displays how these components all interact with one another.

### User Story
```md
As a USER, I want to be able to browse through a list of available items and their prices SO THAT I can see what I am able to order.

THEN I can see the descriptions of available items SO THAT I can see what it is before I make my order.

THEN I can create an order with a list of the items I’m about to purchase on the sidebar SO THAT I can keep track of my order and how much I am spending on them.

THEN I can checkout an order where I am directed to a page SO THAT I can confirm my checkout.
```
